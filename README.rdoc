== Cloudr

Cloudr was made as a student project by Tyler Brewer and Tyler Machen at Flatiron School. We used Ruby on Rails and D3.js to make Cloudr. For commments or suggestions, send Tyler Machen or I a message and we will get back to you (or submit an issue).

If you clone the repo and try to run the app on your local computer, make sure to run 'bundle' as well as 'rake db:seed' to get all of the Reddit categories. If you have any issues, please let us know :)
